c64-reu.emd (c64_reu_emd)
A driver for the CBM REUs. The driver will determine from the connected REU if it supports 128KB of RAM or more. In the latter case, 256KB are assumed, but since there are no range checks, the application can use more memory if it has better knowledge about the hardware than the driver.
